Importing a library in javascript using typescript:

Example:

1. Say to my project to use node package manager:
   npm init -f: It'll create a file named: package.json with some configurations.
2. Add a dependency from node:
   npm install --save lodash@4.14: It'll add a dependency to our project.
3. Add the @types directory from node:
   npm install --save-dev @types/lodash@4.14
